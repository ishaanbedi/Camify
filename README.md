# Camify

This is a simple front-end application that demonstrates creating a reflective ui in SwiftUI using device's camera.

## References
This application uses [CameraView](https://github.com/brettfazio/CameraView) as a dependency to get access to the device's camera and present the feed in a view.

## Reflective UI
Recently, I came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1632405969190748166) about creating reflective UI in SwiftUI. 

I thought it was a really cool idea and wanted to try it out myself.
